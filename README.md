### Hi friends! 👋

I'm a staff software developer currently at StackAdapt. Living in Toronto, Canada but originally from Australia. Always keen to help where I can. I write about tech, and the things that I'm learning. Worked with Ruby, Rails, JS/TS, Node. Weak opinions on architecture, strong opinions on developer experience.
